## Notes of the current release, 1.0.5

- Release date: 2017/07/15.
- Supported Operative Systems: GNU/Linux x86, GNU/Linux x64 and Windows (x86 and x64).
- Supported boards: CIAA-NXP y EDU-CIAA-NXP.
- Added detection of data types and indication of errors.
- Internationalization of the GUI, allowing to change between English and Spanish.

This software is under development. The present version can program the platforms CIAA-NXP and EDU-CIAA-NXP in LADDER DIAGRAM IEC 61131-3 language.

The generated program called MAIN_TASK runs in a single periodic task every 20 ms. This task triggers a program organization unit (POU) of type Program called MAIN_PROGRAM.

MAIN_PROGRAM is the only POU that allows modifying the program, contains previously declared interface variables and Digital Outputs, and some internal variables.

In the CIAA-NXP the Digital Inputs are I0 to I7 and the Digital Outputs are from Q0 to Q7. Not support for analog inputs or outputs yet.

In the EDU-CIAA-NXP the Digital Inputs are TEC1 to TEC4 and the Digital Outputs correspond to LEDR, LEDG, LEDB, LED1, LED2
And LED3. Not support for analog inputs or outputs yet.

### How to "install" IDE4PLC?

Please read "docs/ide4plc-install_en.md" or "docs/ide4plc-install_es.md".

### How to open IDE4PLC?

To open it you must run the Pharo-Smalltak environment:

- Linux: Open a terminal and run ./ide4plc
- Windows: Open executale file Pharo.exe
   
### Using IDE4PLC
  
Open IDE4PLC, create a program in LADDER DIAGRAM using the POUs editor (which opens from the corresponding icon).

- **Generate C code**: Generate the C code in the folder: "IDE4PLC/IDE4PLC_user_projects/plc_application".
- **Build**: Executes the "make" command that compiles the C code ito a binary file.
- **Download**: Run the "make download" command that downloads binary file to the microcontroller flash.
- **Generate C, Build and Download code**: Execute all 3 steps above.
- **Clean**: Execute the "make clean" command that deletes the files generated by the previous C compilation. Required when you change the target board.
